# Asteroid-Collision-Detector
This project simulates Earth’s orbit traffic and uses machine learning to predict potential satellite/debris collision risks. The web dashboard visually shows orbits in real-time, flags predicted near-misses, and lets users explore how risk changes over time or under different maneuvers.
